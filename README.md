## Usage Instructions

### Python

#### 1. Running Algorithms and Data Structures

You can import and use any function or class from `algos.py` in your own scripts:

```python
from algos import bubble_sort, binary_search, Stack, Queue, LinkedList

arr = [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
sorted_arr = bubble_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)

stack = Stack()
stack.push(10)
print("Stack top:", stack.peek())
```

### Java

#### 1. Compiling and Running

To compile the Java algorithms file:

```bash
javac algos.java
```

To run the compiled Java program:

```bash
java algos
```

The main method demonstrates usage of various algorithms and data structures.

#### 2. Using Algorithms and Data Structures

You can instantiate and use the provided data structures and algorithms as shown in the `main` method or by importing the classes into your own Java projects.
